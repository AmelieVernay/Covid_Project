Introduction
============


As you probably know, since the end of 2019, the world is facing `the Covid-19 pandemic`_.
You might feel quite confused with everything that is being said here and there about the evolution of heath situation. Here is where **vizcovidfr** comes into play.
The package won't cure any ills, but hopefully it will provide you an easy way to understand the changing situation in France.


We warn you thought: this is a *very* rudimentary analysis that we made here, and the accuracy of the results is far away from the one you could find on very serious (and boring) official health agency.
What we present here is just a simple visualization tool that we wanted to make as interactive as possible.

All the datasets that we used are taken from `data.gouv.fr`_.

If you are interested, go ahead and follow the installation tutorial to get started!
