Installation guide
==================

For many good reasons, it is recommended to use virtual environments to install packages. To do so, one can follow `this tutorial`_.

.. _this tutorial: https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment

To install vizcovidfr, enter the following command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ pip install vizcovidfr==0.0.4

**Note**

You might need to use pip3 instead of pip depending on your system. You can use the following command to know which pip to use:

.. code-block:: bash

	$ pip --version
	$ pip3 --version


The one that does not give you a *Command not found* message is the one you should use.


Alright! You are now ready to use **vizcovidfr**. Don't know where to start? Why not choose any function in the documentation and start with one of the examples provided?
